<!-- DOM - Document Object Model
Specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and
 update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
Structural elements of an HTML page.
A tree of JS objects used to render the view.
Each HTML tag is a JS object.
Dom Parsing	
Loads entire page into memory
Creates tree with all tags
Can read or edit
Slow
Uses Sax Parsing

Sax Parsing
Sequential API for XML Parsing
Pulls 1 line at a time into memory
Goes sequentially through file
Cannot edit
faster

DOM Selection and Manipulation
How to use JS to change the look and behavior of your webpage.
To find elements, we need to use our document object. It is the object that has 
all of the representations of our HTML elements. We can retrieve elements by
 id names (attribute), tag names and class names (also an attribute).
 (In a js file)
 document.getElementById(id)
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
document.getElementsByClassName(class)

Interacting with elements
[element].innerHTML          	[] not part of the notation
[element].[attribute]
[element].setAttribute([attribute], [value])
[element].style

Adding/Removing elements
We need to use our document and register the element with said document.
document.createElement()
[element].appendChild(element)
[element].removeChild(element)
[element].replaceChild

Navigation:
parentNode
childNodes[index]
firstChild
lastChild
previousSibling
nextSibling

Event
Some occurrence in our client-side environment, which we can respond to programmatically.
Types
Input events
    onchange
    onfocus
    onsubmit
    onkeydown
    onkeypress
    etc.
Mouse events
    onmousemove
    onmouseover
    Etc.
Click events
    onclick
    ondoubleclick
Load events
    onload
    onrestore
    onrefresh
    Etc.
Event Object -
     a JS representation of the most recent event that has fired. 
    Very dynamic - lots of events occur. Has a number of important properties.

    Event Listeners (JavaScript)
    3 ways of implementing event listeners
        Inline
            <button onclick="someFunction">HI</button>
            Couples structure and behavior unnecessarily
            (views and scripts too tightly coupled). Generally not preferred, obtrusive.
        Method
            [element].onclick = function(){ … };
        Long form
            [element].addEventListener(type, handler, useCapture);
            useCapture is an optional parameter that defaults to false.(bubbling)
            Type: “click”, “mouseover”, etc. Events without “on” in front of their names.
            Event handler function can (and should) be passed as a parameter.- no Parantheses
